<h1>Dental Patient Appointments System</h1>

This is the project I completed for the Computing project of NCC L5 second year, second semester. This assignment involves scheduling appointments in a dental clinic. 
The dental clinic described in this project truly exists.  
I went to the clinic myself and completed the project.  
The project features three admin dashboards: management, dentists, and receptionist.When the manager creates the timetable, the date must be drawn in advance.  
The dentist maintains the patient's medical records.  
When the patient arrives, the receptionist must approve their appointment and change their status to arrived.  
The patient must create an account and schedule an appointment. 
When arranging an appointment, you can only select the schedule that displays three days in advance.
